Eric Howard code review by Aaron Rash

Thank you for the very thorough commenting on this project. I greatly appreciate it.

The logic/syntax is correct, and there are no issues I'm aware of.
I do think it can be shortened/modularized however.

Each Datatable method (sortByStatesAsc, sortByPopulation, etc) creates a new OleDbCommand, and then uses the same 4 lines of code to execute it basically.
I dont have quite enough time to test it, but I'm fairly certain you could pull those lines out into a new method. Lets say we name it 'executeCommand'
Then you can call 'executeCommand' from your Datatable methods.
That way, you would shorten the code, while keeping it nice and readable.

Also I am so glad I reviewed this code, because you implement a solution I was stuck on for ages and had given up on.
I was using OleDbDataAdapters in one of my assignments as well and had been running into some problems, so I feel like I learned something useful from this.

Nice work.
