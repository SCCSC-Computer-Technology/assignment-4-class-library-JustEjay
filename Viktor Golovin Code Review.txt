First off, the program worked well and ran without issues. I liked how the data was presented and it was thorough and easy to read/take in information.
Speaking of easy to read great job on the comments. They really helped my understand the code and helped me understand things better, about how it works and runs. 
Overall great submission, i enjoyed running the program and understanding all the code from the comments.
