The code appears to be syntactically correct and should compile without errors or warnings. The code is very readable, it contains inline comments explaining the purpose of methods and their parameters. There is some repetitive code in the methods that retrieve data from the database and populate DataTable objects. This repetitive code could potentially be refactored into a private method to improve code maintainability. There's no apparent dead code and no software defects are found either. Exception handling is not explicitly implemented. Adding exception handling mechanisms, especially around database operations that could potentially fail, would improve the robustness of the code. This authors library was much more complex than my own. Whether it be a differnence in understanding of the assignemnt or an overall more robust approach, this authors shows significatn skill and expertise in their understanding and execution of the material. I would have to incorporate each library into a specific application to have a preference, but I think both libraries would complete the necessary task. Overall feedback includes: Consider refactoring repetitive code into private methods to improve code maintainability. Implement proper exception handling mechanisms to handle potential errors during database operations.
